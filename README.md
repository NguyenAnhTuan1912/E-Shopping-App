# E-Shopping-App
I build a ios/android app for E-shopping with react native & expo

See my E-shopping projects:
* [E-shopping with Angular](https://github.com/NguyenAnhTuan1912/E-shopping-with-Angular)
* [E-shopping API](https://github.com/NguyenAnhTuan1912/E-shopping-API)

## My main goals in this project

I want to learn `How to build a mobile app` for my study. I have learnt react before,
but It's react/react-dom. After learning react native, I realize react native is so
powerfull, I make me feel like __I'm develop web app__. Why I can affirm that?
I have learn `Flutter` for a short time ago. I bring me to the new world of
__Mobile app development__, syntax, function, logic is difference...

New things is good, I agree with that. But as I said "I make me feel like __I'm develop web app__".
In one day, I will learn more about `Flutter`.

## What did I learn about React native?
* _What is react native?_ React native is a UI framework for mobile development. It was developed by Meta.
* _What are Native components and Core components?_ Native components are components can create corresponding views
from (ios and android). Core components are basic of native components that we use to build our app most.
* _What is Navigation?_ Navigation is a movement of a screen to top of a Stack (Route Stack). When new route
push to Stack, its component will be pop to top. Otherwise, If this route existed, Stack would pop its component
to the top of Stack.

Ok, this is all of my think. I will update it soon.
